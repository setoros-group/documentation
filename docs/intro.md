Setoros is a decentralized sportsbetting protocol hosted on Arbitrum Network. It features competitive odds and deep liquidity for bettors rivaling that of popular centralized sportsbetting websites. Setoros decentralizes bookmaking by allowing liquidity providers to act as *The House*, to share in the profits generated by sportsbettors, and to contribute to the liquidity of the various betting markets on the platform. Setoros supports betting markets in various currencies, such as USDC, ETH, WBTC, and more to come.

As a decentralized protocol, bettors can enjoy sportsbetting from anywhere in the world with full custody over their own funds and with no registration, login, or KYC.
