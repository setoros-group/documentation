# My Bets

## My Bets Page

 You can navigate to the *My Bets* page on the main navigation bar at the top of the page (circled in red). The *My Bets* page is used for viewing your currently placed bets, historical bets, and claiming your winning bets.

Here, you can toggle between **(1)** *Open* and *Settled* bets. *Open Bets* are bets that you've made where the game has not been finished or resolved to a winner yet, while *Settled Bets* are games that have finished, and for which you have definitively won or lost (or tied) the bet. NOTE: If you have any bets which you think we've gotten the results incorrect, and would like to dispute the match, please either open a support ticket on our Discord or email us at admin@setoros.com

You can also view your account information **(2)**, such as your wallet balances, as well as how much you currently have bet in ongoing games, as well as how much you have in unclaimed winnings.

## Claiming Winnings

You can claim your winnings under *Settled Bets*. Your winning bets are highlighted in green, while your lost bets are highlighted in red. Alternatively, if you tied in a match, or if a match is cancelled, you can claim your refund of your initial bet size. (NOTE: Due to technical limitations, the protocol currently refunds the initial bet size minus the protocol fees. However, we are working hard to upgrade the smart contracts to handle full refunds. Please stay tuned!)

**IMPORTANT:** You are responsible for claiming your winnings on time. Setoros clears old smart contracts from storage from time to time, typically after a 1 month period, so **YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO WINNINGS** if you do not claim your winnings within the 1 month period. If you have experienced any lost funds because you did not claim on time, please open a support ticket on our Discord or email us at admin@setoros.com so we can attempt to recover any lost funds.
